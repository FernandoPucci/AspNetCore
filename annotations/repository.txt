http://bit.ly/repo-vs-query 

Repository shoudn't return IQueryble, because some method, some where can change properties of the object. 

Repository don't have a Save method. Because in transactionals operations, we can make mistakes, saving a child object
 whithout his master or may using many repositories;
    To avoid this problems, we'll implement "Unit of Work" pattern. UoW walks hand-to-hand with Repository pattern.
